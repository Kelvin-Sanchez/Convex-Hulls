# Convex-Hulls
Use of Convex Hulls for Dataset shift detection to prevent/detect covariate shifts(feature shift)

Project came about during my assured autonomy course, which questioned how we can protect Learning Enabled Cyber Physical Systems. I mentioned the use of polygons to detect shifts in features(covariate shift). Covariate shifts can cause performance drops in accuracy leading to incorrect labeling/predictions. This is seen in medical scenarios where models may incorrectly diagnose patients leading to harm. I thought to apply Convex Hulls to detect these changes to prevent such incidents and hopefully allow data scientists to intervene to select an appropriate approach. Although the project is incomplete, the end goal is to find an application of CHs to Camera systems in LE-CPS to prevent/detect Adversarial Examples. The data generation algorithm was created with the help of Google's Gemini. At this point, the handling of outliers must be handled correctly since outliers can greatly alter the area calculated. This difference in area also causes variations in area difference between two convex hulls.
